# Reference implementation structure
def sae_loss(activations, encoder, decoder):
    # Encode with sparsity
    encoded = F.relu(encoder(activations))

    reconstructed = decoder(encoded)
    # L2 reconstruction loss
    recon_loss = F.mse_loss(reconstructed, activations)
    # L1 sparsity penalty
    sparsity_loss = encoded.abs().mean()
    return recon_loss + lambda_sparse * sparsity_loss
```
