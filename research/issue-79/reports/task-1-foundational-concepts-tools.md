# Task 1: Foundational Concepts and Tools in Mechanistic Interpretability

## Overview

Mechanistic interpretability (MI) is the field of reverse engineering neural networks to understand their internal computational mechanisms. According to [Neel Nanda's comprehensive glossary](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/glossary), it aims to decode how models process information into human-understandable algorithms and concepts.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Features and Circuits

According to [Cloud Security Alliance's MI 101 guide](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2024/09/05/mechanistic-interpretability-101), the two fundamental concepts in mechanistic interpretability are:

- **Features**: Specific properties or patterns that neural networks learn to recognize and process. These are the building blocks of model understanding.
- **Circuits**: Groups of neurons that work together to perform specific computations. These are the "functional units" responsible for processing and combining features to produce outputs.

### 2. Superposition

Based on research from the [ICML 2024 MI Workshop](https://icml2024mi.pages.dev/), superposition is a key hypothesis stating that model activations are represented in a compressed format where multiple features share the same dimensions. This leads to polysemanticity - individual neurons responding to multiple unrelated concepts.

### 3. Induction Heads

According to [Transformer Circuits research](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html), induction heads are attention patterns that perform "match-and-copy" operations and appear to be the mechanistic source of in-context learning in transformers. They emerge during a phase change early in training when in-context learning ability improves dramatically.

## Essential Tools and Libraries

### 1. TransformerLens

[TransformerLens](https://github.com/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens) is the primary library for mechanistic interpretability of GPT-style language models. According to the [official documentation](https://transformerlensorg.github.io/TransformerLens/index.html):

- Allows loading open-source models up to 9B parameters
- Exposes internal activations and allows caching any activation
- Enables editing, removing, or replacing activations during model runs
- Best for complex interpretability experiments on smaller models
- Works well in Google Colab notebooks without requiring large compute

### 2. SAELens

As described in the [ARENA tutorials](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LnHowHgmrMbWtpkxx/interpretability-with-sparse-autoencoders-colab-exercises), SAELens is a library for training and using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs):

- Implements sparse dictionary learning for feature extraction
- Integrates with Weights & Biases for experiment tracking
- Provides evaluation metrics for SAE quality
- Supports loading pre-trained SAEs from various releases

### 3. Neuronpedia

According to [ARENA exercises](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/LnHowHgmrMbWtpkxx/interpretability-with-sparse-autoencoders-colab-exercises), Neuronpedia is a platform for:

- Visualizing and exploring discovered features
- Sharing interpretability findings with the community
- Browsing pre-analyzed features from various models
- Understanding feature activations across different contexts

### 4. NNsight

Based on [recent implementations](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.12202v1), NNsight is used for:

- Model intervention and activation editing
- Implementing causal interventions
- Working with recommendation systems and other non-language models

## Key Techniques

### 1. Activation Patching

According to [ARENA Chapter 1.4.1](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/getting-started), activation patching is a core technique involving:

- Replacing activations at specific positions with those from different inputs
- Measuring the causal effect on model outputs
- Identifying which components are responsible for specific behaviors

### 2. Direct Logit Attribution

As described in [TransformerLens tutorials](https://transformerlensorg.github.io/TransformerLens/content/getting_started_mech_interp.html):

- Decomposing the final logit computation
- Attributing predictions to specific model components
- Understanding which layers and heads contribute to outputs

### 3. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)

According to [Adam Karvonen's tutorial](https://adamkarvonen.github.io/machine_learning/2024/06/11/sae-intuitions.html), SAEs:

- Learn sparse, interpretable features from dense activations
- Use L1 regularization to enforce sparsity
- Help overcome polysemanticity by decomposing activations
- Typical implementation includes ReLU activation for sparsity

### Recommended Learning Path

According to [Neel Nanda's recent guide](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/getting-started) (updated 2 weeks ago), the optimal learning sequence is:

1. **Essential**: ARENA Chapter 1.2 (Interpretability Basics) - Focus on tooling, direct observation, and patching
2. **Recommended**: Chapter 1.4.1 (Causal Interventions & Activation Patching)
3. **Worthwhile**: Chapter 1.3.2 (Sparse Autoencoders) - Understanding intuition, strengths/weaknesses, using open-source SAEs

### Practical Implementation

According to the [2024 MI review](https://leonardbereska.github.io/blog/2024/mechinterpreview/), the minimum viable basics include:

- Code a transformer from scratch to understand architecture
- Learn key mechanistic interpretability techniques
- Understand the landscape of the field
- Build linear algebra intuitions
- Practice writing mechanistic interpretability code

## Recent Developments (2024)

Based on the [ICML 2024 Workshop](https://icml2024mi.pages.dev/), current focus areas include:

1. **Decoding Superposition**: Advanced work on sparse autoencoders and dictionary learning
2. **Scaling and Automation**: Reducing dependence on manual analysis
3. **Real-world Applications**: Studying jailbreaks, hallucinations, and other phenomena
4. **Multi-phase Circuit Discovery**: Understanding complex emergence patterns beyond simple induction heads
