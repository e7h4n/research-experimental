# Task 3: Claude Code Router Architecture

## Executive Summary

Claude Code's router architecture consists of multiple layers: internal command routing through slash commands, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for external tool integration, and third-party router solutions that enable multi-model support. This comprehensive routing system enables flexible command dispatching, tool integration, and intelligent model selection.

## Internal Architecture Overview

### Core Components

According to [Anthropic's MCP documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp), Claude Code's architecture includes:

1. **Environment Integration**: Inherits bash environment and functions as both MCP server and client
2. **Memory Files**: CLAUDE.md files containing instructions and context loaded at startup
3. **Settings Files**: JSON configuration for permissions, environment variables, and tool behavior
4. **Slash Commands**: Invoked during sessions with `/command-name`
5. **MCP Servers**: Extend Claude Code with additional tools and integrations

### Command Routing Mechanism

Based on [Claude Code Best Practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices), the routing system handles:
- Direct terminal commands through bash integration
- Slash command invocation and parameter passing
- MCP tool selection and execution
- Dynamic context management with `/clear` command

## Slash Command System

### Command Architecture

According to [Anthropic's Slash Commands documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands), custom slash commands:
- Are defined as Markdown files in `.claude/commands` folder
- Support namespacing through directory structures
- Can be project-specific or personal in scope
- Integrate with version control for team sharing

### Dynamic Command Features

As detailed in [Awesome Claude Code repository](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code):

1. **Argument Passing**: Use `$ARGUMENTS` keyword for dynamic parameters
2. **Context Management**: Commands like `/add-dir` expand workspace organically
3. **Permission Control**: `/permissions` launches interactive permission UI
4. **MCP Integration**: MCP servers expose prompts as slash commands dynamically

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### MCP Architecture

According to [Anthropic's MCP announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol), MCP provides:
- Open standard for secure, two-way connections
- Uniform interface to databases, tools, and APIs
- Standardized protocol for LLM application connections

### MCP Components

As described in [MCP Documentation](https://www.claudemcp.com/docs/introduction):

1. **Host Applications**: Claude Desktop, IDEs, standalone applications
2. **MCP Clients**: Connectors maintaining 1:1 stateful sessions
3. **MCP Servers**: Expose data and tools through standard protocol
4. **Tools & APIs**: External services accessible through MCP

### Configuration Scopes

According to [Claude Code settings documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings), MCP servers can be configured at:
- **Project-specific**: `.claude/settings.local.json` in project directory
- **User-specific**: Personal configuration for all projects
- **Local-scoped**: Default level, private to user and project

## Claude Code Router Implementation

### Router Architecture

According to [Claude Code Router GitHub](https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router), the router provides:

1. **Multi-Provider Support**: Routes to OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Ollama, Gemini, Volcengine, SiliconFlow
2. **Request/Response Transformation**: Customizes for different providers
3. **Dynamic Model Switching**: Uses `/model` command for runtime changes

### Routing Configuration

As documented on [Claude Code Router website](https://claudecoderouter.com/):

```javascript
{
  "router": {
    "default": "provider_name,model_name",
    "background": "provider_name,model_name",
    "think": "provider_name,model_name",
    "longContext": "provider_name,model_name"
  }
}
```

### Custom Router Logic

Based on [ClaudeLog documentation](https://claudelog.com/claude-code-mcps/claude-code-router/):

- Custom router scripts via `CUSTOM_ROUTER_PATH`
- JavaScript module exporting async function
- Receives request and config objects
- Returns provider and model name string

## Request Processing Flow

### Internal Routing Logic

According to [Claude Code Complete Guide](https://www.siddharthbharath.com/claude-code-the-complete-guide/):

1. **Request Initiation**: User input or slash command triggers request
2. **Context Analysis**: System evaluates request type and context
3. **Route Selection**: Determines appropriate model/provider based on rules
4. **Transformation**: Applies necessary request modifications
5. **Execution**: Routes to selected endpoint
6. **Response Processing**: Transforms and returns results

### Token Management

As specified in [MCP Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user):
- Output warning threshold at 10,000 tokens
- Configurable limit via `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS`
- Default maximum of 25,000 tokens

## Logging and Monitoring

### Log Architecture

According to [Claude Code Router documentation](https://claudelog.com/claude-code-mcps/claude-code-router/):

1. **Server-level Logs**: HTTP requests, API calls in `~/.claude-code-router/logs/ccr-*.log`
2. **Application Logs**: Routing decisions in `~/.claude-code-router/claude-code-router.log`
3. **Pino Logger**: Structured logging for all events

## Advanced Features

### Context-Based Routing

As described in [Shipyard's Claude Code Cheatsheet](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/):
- Background tasks route to efficient models
- Complex reasoning uses specialized models
- Long context triggers high-capacity models
- Web search routes to online-capable models

### GitHub Actions Integration
