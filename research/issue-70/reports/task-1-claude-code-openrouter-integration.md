# Task 1: Claude Code and OpenRouter Integration

## Executive Summary

Claude Code, Anthropic's terminal-based AI coding assistant, can be enhanced through integration with OpenRouter, a unified API service that provides access to 400+ AI models from 60+ providers. This integration enables model routing, cost optimization, and fallback capabilities while maintaining Claude Code's familiar developer experience.

## Claude Code Overview

According to [Anthropic's official documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview), Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that:
- Lives in your terminal and understands your entire codebase
- Executes routine tasks through natural language commands
- Handles git workflows and multi-file edits
- Integrates with VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, and GitHub

### Key Technical Capabilities

As documented on [Claude Code's GitHub repository](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code):
- **Terminal Integration**: Works directly in your terminal with existing tools
- **Takes Action**: Can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits
- **Unix Philosophy**: Composable and scriptable with command piping support
- **MCP Integration**: Connects to external data sources like Google Drive, Jira, and Slack
- **Model Support**: Works with Claude Opus 4.1, Claude Sonnet 4, and Claude Haiku 3.5

## OpenRouter Service Overview

[OpenRouter's documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/overview/models) describes it as a unified API gateway that:
- Provides access to hundreds of AI models through a single endpoint
- Normalizes schemas across providers to comply with OpenAI Chat API
- Handles automatic fallbacks and cost optimization
- Offers intelligent provider routing based on price or throughput priorities

### Core OpenRouter Features

According to [OpenRouter's API documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api-reference/overview):
- **Auto Router**: Automatically selects optimal models based on prompts
- **Fallback Models**: Seamlessly switches to backup models during outages
- **Provider Routing**: Load balances across multiple providers for maximum uptime
- **Token Counting**: Provides precise token accounting using native tokenizers
- **Rate Limits**: Manages free tier (20 req/min) and paid tier limits

## Integration Architecture

### Claude Code Router

[Claude Code Router](https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router) enables model routing by:
- Acting as a middleware layer between Claude Code and various model providers
- Supporting OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Ollama, Gemini, and other providers
- Providing request/response transformation for provider compatibility
- Enabling dynamic model switching via the `/model` command

### Configuration Implementation

As detailed in [Beyond Anthropic: Using Claude Code with Any Model](https://lgallardo.com/2025/08/20/claude-code-router-openrouter-beyond-anthropic/), the integration requires:

1. **Installation Steps**:
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
npm install -g @musistudio/claude-code-router
```

2. **Configuration File** (`~/.claude-code-router/config.json`):
- Router object defines model selection logic
- longContextThreshold triggers specialized models for large contexts
- Custom router scripts enable advanced routing logic

3. **Environment Variables**:
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: Points to router or OpenRouter endpoint
- `AUTH_TOKEN`: Authentication for the routing service

### Y-Router Alternative

[Y-Router](https://github.com/luohy15/y-router) provides a simpler proxy approach:
- Acts as a transparent proxy between Claude Code and OpenRouter
- Requires minimal configuration changes
- Maintains full Claude Code functionality while routing to different models

## Model Selection and Routing Strategies

### Available Models via OpenRouter

According to [ClaudeLog's documentation](https://claudelog.com/claude-code-mcps/claude-code-router/), popular models include:
- **Qwen3 Coder**: Free model optimized for coding with 262K context window
- **DeepSeek R1**: Strong reasoning capabilities for debugging
- **OpenAI gpt-oss-20b**: Open-weight model with solid general performance

### Routing Logic

As documented in [Claude Code Router documentation](https://claudecoderouter.com/):
- **Background Tasks**: Route to cost-effective models
- **Complex Reasoning**: Use specialized reasoning models
- **Long Context**: Automatically switch to models with larger context windows
- **Web Search**: Route to models with online capabilities (using `:online` suffix)

## Benefits and Use Cases

### Cost Optimization

According to [OpenRouter's model routing documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/model-routing):
- Automatically selects most cost-effective providers
- Free tier models for simple tasks
- Premium models only when needed

### Reliability and Uptime

As detailed in [OpenRouter's provider routing documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/provider-routing):
- Automatic fallback during provider outages
- Load balancing across multiple providers
- Error-triggered model switching

### Flexibility

Based on [Using Claude Code with Open Models](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow/wiki/Using-Claude-Code-with-Open-Models):
- Mix open-source and proprietary models
- Use local models for privacy-sensitive work
- Access specialized models for specific tasks

## Implementation Best Practices

### Security Considerations

- Keep API keys secure and never commit to repositories
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Performance Optimization

According to [OpenRouter's API parameters documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api-reference/parameters):
- Use `require_parameters` to ensure provider compatibility
- Configure `max_tokens` appropriately for each model
- Implement streaming for real-time responses

### Monitoring and Debugging

- Track token usage via `/api/v1/generation` endpoint
- Monitor rate limits with `/api/v1/key` endpoint
- Log model selection decisions for optimization

## Conclusion

The integration of Claude Code with OpenRouter transforms it from a single-model tool to a flexible, multi-model platform. This combination provides developers with cost optimization, improved reliability through fallbacks, and access to specialized models while maintaining Claude Code's powerful terminal-based interface. The architecture supports both simple proxy approaches (Y-Router) and sophisticated routing logic (Claude Code Router), allowing teams to choose the complexity level that matches their needs.
