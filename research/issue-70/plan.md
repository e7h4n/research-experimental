# Research Plan for Issue #70

## Intent Analysis
**Keywords/Concepts Identified:** 
- Claude Code (Anthropic's AI coding assistant)
- OpenRouter (model routing service)
- y-router (routing system/concept)
- Claude Code router (routing within Claude Code)
- Best practices
- GitHub issues (workflow integration)

**Inferred Research Intent:** 
The user appears to be interested in understanding routing architectures and implementations, specifically:
1. How Claude Code can integrate with OpenRouter for model selection/routing
2. The concept and implementation of y-router systems
3. Claude Code's internal routing mechanisms
4. Best practices for implementing router systems in AI coding assistants
5. How these routing systems integrate with GitHub issue workflows

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- What is OpenRouter and how can it be integrated with Claude Code?
- What is y-router and what are its applications in routing systems?
- How does Claude Code handle internal routing of requests and commands?
- What are the best practices for implementing router architectures?
- How can router systems optimize GitHub issue workflow automation?

## Research Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Research Claude Code and OpenRouter integration possibilities
- [ ] Task 2: Investigate y-router concepts, implementations, and applications
- [ ] Task 3: Analyze Claude Code's internal router architecture and capabilities
- [ ] Task 4: Document best practices for router implementations in AI systems
- [ ] Task 5: Explore GitHub issues workflow integration with routing systems

## Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of how model routing services like OpenRouter can enhance Claude Code
- Clear documentation of y-router patterns and their benefits
- Insight into Claude Code's architecture for handling different types of requests
- Comprehensive best practices guide for implementing robust routing systems
- Practical strategies for integrating routing systems with GitHub workflow automation
