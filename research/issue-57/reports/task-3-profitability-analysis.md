# Task 3: EV OEM Profitability Patterns Analysis

## Executive Summary
Based on comprehensive analysis of NET PROFIT data, EV OEMs can be categorized into three distinct groups based on their profitability patterns. Each category exhibits specific characteristics and underlying factors driving their financial performance.

## Category A: 持续盈利 (Consistently Profitable)

### Tesla (USA)
**Profitability Pattern:**
- 2021-2023: Strong growth in net profit ($5.5B → $15B)
- 2024: Decline to $7.1B (still profitable)

**Success Factors:**
1. **Premium Positioning**: Earning $10,000-$15,000 per vehicle sold vs competitors' much lower margins
2. **Vertical Integration**: Building most components in-house reduces supplier dependency and costs
3. **Manufacturing Excellence**: AI-optimized production lines and "learning by doing" economies of scale
4. **Strategic Localization**: Building vehicles close to markets reduces tariffs and shipping costs
5. **Diversification**: High-margin energy storage solutions (9.4 GWh in Q1 2024, +75% growth expected)
