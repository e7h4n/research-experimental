## Market Context and Timing

### Favorable IPO Environment
The timing proved advantageous within the broader market context:

- **Market Momentum:** Strong performance of venture-backed IPOs in 2025
- **Investor Appetite:** High demand for AI-focused and design technology companies

### Adobe Deal Background Impact
The abandoned $20 billion Adobe acquisition in 2023 created the IPO opportunity:

- **Independence Value:** Investors valued Figma's maintained independence and growth trajectory

## Legal Settlement Impact on IPO

- **Risk Mitigation:** Resolved major intellectual property litigation
- **Market Clarity:** Eliminated uncertainty about competitive threats
- **Investor Confidence:** Demonstrated ability to protect intellectual property

### Limited Market Reaction
The muted 0.35% stock reaction to the settlement announcement suggests investors:
- Already expected favorable resolution
- Viewed Motiff as a minor competitive threat
- Focused more on growth prospects than litigation outcomes

## Future Prospects and Challenges
