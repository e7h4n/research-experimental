# Research Plan for Issue #84

## Intent Analysis
**Keywords/Concepts Identified:** DeFi, AI Agents, Corporate structure in DeFi, Decentralized financing, Token governance, Autonomous economic systems

**Inferred Research Intent:** The user wants to understand the feasibility of creating a fully autonomous economic system where DeFi-based companies operated entirely by AI agents can function without human intervention, with governance through token-based voting.

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- Can companies legally and technically exist purely within DeFi ecosystems?
- How can AI agents provide services and generate revenue in a DeFi context?
- What are successful models of token-based governance for operational decisions?
- Are there existing examples of autonomous economic systems?
- What are the technical, legal, and economic challenges?

## Research Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Research DeFi-based corporate structures and DAOs
- [ ] Task 2: Investigate AI agent economic models and service provision
- [ ] Task 3: Analyze token-based governance mechanisms for operational decisions
- [ ] Task 4: Explore autonomous economic systems and human-free organizations

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive analysis of feasibility for DeFi-AI agent companies
- Examples of existing similar systems or components
- Technical and regulatory challenges identification
- Potential implementation approaches
- Assessment of autonomous economic system viability
