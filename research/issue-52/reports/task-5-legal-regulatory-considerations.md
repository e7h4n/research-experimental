## Global Legal Landscape

### United States - Strict Prohibitions

The **Marine Mammal Protection Act** establishes the most comprehensive restrictions globally:

- **Complete import ban**: No seal skin products can be imported into the USA
- **Export restrictions**: Prohibits export of marine mammal parts
- **"Taking" definition**: Includes hunt, harass, capture, or kill any marine mammal
- **Products included**: Any item wholly or partially composed of marine mammals

#### Enforcement and Penalties  
- **Violation consequences**: Federal criminal and civil penalties
- **Current status**: Actively enforced as of 2024
- **Recent updates**: Import restrictions remain until December 31, 2029

### European Union - Import Restrictions

#### EU Seal Products Regulation
- **Ban scope**: Prohibits placing seal products on EU market
- **Implementation date**: 2010, with ongoing enforcement
- **Limited exceptions**: Traditional Inuit/Indigenous hunting
- **Member state compliance**: All 27 EU countries enforce restrictions

### Other Restricted Markets

### For Other Markets
**Country-Specific Research Required**
- Laws vary significantly by jurisdiction
- Many countries follow US or EU lead
