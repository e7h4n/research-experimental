# Research Plan for Issue #39

## Intent Analysis
**Keywords/Concepts Identified:** React external state management, Jotai, Zustand, CCState, RxJS, Redux, comparison, code examples, performance

**Inferred Research Intent:** The user wants a comprehensive comparison of external state management solutions for React applications, focusing on practical implementation differences, performance characteristics, and use case recommendations.

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- What are the key differences between these state management approaches?
- How do they compare in terms of performance and bundle size?
- What are the practical code examples for each library?
- Which library is best suited for different use cases?
- What are the learning curves and ecosystem maturity levels?

## Research Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Deep dive into Jotai - atomic state management approach
- [ ] Task 2: Analyze Zustand - bear-necessities state management
- [ ] Task 3: Investigate CCState - concurrent-safe state management
- [ ] Task 4: Study RxJS - reactive programming for state management
- [ ] Task 5: Review Redux - predictable state container patterns
- [ ] Task 6: Performance benchmarking and bundle size analysis
- [ ] Task 7: Comparative code examples and use case scenarios
- [ ] Task 8: Developer experience and ecosystem comparison

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive understanding of each library's philosophy and approach
- Practical code examples showing real-world usage patterns
- Performance comparison data with benchmarks
- Clear recommendations for different use cases and project requirements
- Understanding of migration paths and learning curves
