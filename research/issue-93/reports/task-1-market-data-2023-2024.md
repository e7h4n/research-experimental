## Data Quality Assessment

### Reliable Sources
- AMIC monthly/quarterly reports (industry standard)
- IEA Global EV Outlook (international benchmark)
- Insurance pool registrations (official data)

### Data Inconsistencies
- EV definitions vary (BEV vs total EVs including PHEV)
- Sales vs registrations terminology used interchangeably
- Time lag between sale and registration affects comparisons

### Critical Data Gaps
- No official BEV-only statistics available
- Limited breakdown by vehicle segment
- Incomplete full-year 2024 data as of research date

## Conclusions

The Egyptian automotive market experienced severe contraction in 2023 (-48% passenger cars) followed by modest recovery in 2024 (+11% estimated). Electric vehicle adoption shows growth from an extremely low base but remains below 1% market penetration. Data quality challenges persist with inconsistent reporting standards and lack of BEV-specific metrics.
