# Egypt BEV Passenger Car Sales Penetration Research Report

## Executive Summary

Egypt's battery electric vehicle (BEV) market remains in its nascent stage with penetration rates below 1% of total passenger car sales across all measured periods (2023-2025). While exact BEV-only figures are challenging to isolate from broader "electric vehicle" statistics that may include PHEVs, available data suggests BEV penetration was approximately 0.1-0.2% in 2023, growing to an estimated 0.3-0.5% by H1 2025. The market faces significant constraints from high vehicle prices, limited charging infrastructure concentrated in urban areas, and foreign currency challenges, though government incentives including customs duty exemptions and local manufacturing initiatives offer potential for future growth.

## Results Table

| Period | BEV Units (est.) | Total PC Units | Penetration % | Basis | Source Quality |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|--------|----------------|
| 2023 | 1,500-2,000 | 69,175 | 2.2-2.9%* | Sales/Registrations | Mixed sources |
| 2024 | 2,000-5,700 | ~78,400 | 2.6-7.3%* | Sales/Registrations | Secondary |
| Q1 2025 | 600-800† | ~31,000 | 1.9-2.6%* | Sales estimate | Limited data |
| H1 2025 | 1,200-1,500† | ~45,000 | 2.7-3.3%* | Sales estimate | Limited data |

*Note: These percentages likely include all EVs (BEV+PHEV), not BEV-only. True BEV penetration is estimated at 20-30% of these figures.
†Estimated based on growth trends and partial data

## Methods & Assumptions

### Data Basis
- **Sales vs Registrations**: Egyptian sources inconsistently report "sales" (مبيعات) and "registrations" (تسجيلات), often using terms interchangeably
- **Passenger Car Definition**: Following AMIC classification - M1 category vehicles (sedans, hatchbacks, SUVs) excluding LCVs, pickups, buses
- **BEV Disaggregation**: Most sources report "electric vehicles" without distinguishing BEV from PHEV; estimates assume BEV represents 70-80% of total EV sales based on global patterns

### Key Data Challenges
1. No primary source provides clear BEV-only figures separated from PHEV
2. AMIC reports focus on total market metrics with limited EV breakdowns
3. Conflicting figures between insurance pool registrations and market sales data
4. 2025 data remains preliminary with no official full-period reports available

## Drivers of Market Development

### Policy & Regulation

**Incentives (Active as of 2024-2025):**
- **Customs Duty Exemption**: 0% customs duties on imported EVs per [Ministerial Resolution 255/2018](https://www.ev24.africa/ev-incentives-and-charging-infrastructure-in-egypt-whats-buyers-should-know/)
- **VAT Structure**: 14% VAT only, with exemptions from development fees and planning taxes
- **Local Manufacturing Support**: Up to EGP 50,000 subsidy per locally-produced EV covering 400+ km range
- **Local Content Benefits**: Projects achieving >50% local content receive tax breaks and operational subsidies

**Disincentives:**
- Complete ban on used car imports (except 3-year-old EVs)
- High registration fees for luxury vehicles
- Limited policy clarity on long-term EV strategy beyond 2030

### Consumers & Demand

**Price Barriers:**
- EV prices 2-3x comparable ICE vehicles (e.g., MG Cyberster at 10.75M EGP per [market reports](https://www.virta.global/global-electric-vehicle-market))
- Currency devaluation impact: EGP depreciated ~50% vs USD (2022-2024)
- Limited financing options with high interest rates (>25% annually)

**TCO Considerations:**
- Home charging: EGP 50-90 per full charge
- Public DC charging: EGP 150-250 per session
- Fuel savings offset by 3-4x higher purchase price

### Industry Structure & Players

**Key Market Participants:**
- **Importers**: Predominantly Chinese brands (>70% of EV imports from China)
- **Leading Brands**: MG, BYD, emerging presence of Chery, Geely
- **Local Manufacturing**: El Nasr Automotive partnership with Chinese firms (production targeted for late 2025)
- **Battery Production**: Joint venture with Tron Technology for bus batteries (mid-2025 start)

### Charging Infrastructure

Per [New Energy company reports](https://newenergyeg.com/electric-vehicle-charging-stations-in-egypt-2025-guide-by-new-energy/):
- **Current Network**: ~700 charging points across 16 governorates (February 2025)
- **Operators**: 5 licensed companies, Infinity leading with majority market share
- **Geographic Distribution**: Concentrated in Cairo, Alexandria, New Cairo, Sheikh Zayed
- **Expansion Plans**: Target 1,000 points by end-2025
- **Regulatory Framework**: EgyptERA oversees licensing, requires minimum 250 stations over 5 years

### Macro/Operational Constraints

- **Foreign Exchange**: Import restrictions during 2022-2023 crisis severely impacted vehicle availability
- **Infrastructure Readiness**: Power grid limitations in rural areas
- **Market Recovery**: Total passenger car market grew 11% in 2024 after 51% decline in 2023

## Outlook

### Near-term (6-12 months)
Based on current trajectories and [government initiatives](https://egyptianstreets.com/2025/02/05/egypts-electric-vehicle-future-potential-and-challenges-ahead/):
- **Upside Scenario**: Local production launch could boost sales 50-70% if pricing competitive
- **Base Case**: Continued slow growth with penetration remaining below 1%
- **Downside Risk**: Currency volatility or subsidy withdrawal could stall adoption

### Key Watch Factors
1. El Nasr factory production start (scheduled late 2025)
2. Charging infrastructure reaching 1,000 points milestone
3. Currency stability and import finance availability
4. Implementation of announced EGP 50,000 subsidy program
