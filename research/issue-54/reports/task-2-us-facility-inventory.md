### Estimated Semiconductor H₂ Generation Calculations

**Mass Balance Approach**:
- Silane consumption: ~0.1-0.5 kg SiH₄ per 300mm wafer (process dependent)
- Stoichiometry: SiH₄ → Si + 2H₂ (molecular weight: SiH₄ = 32, H₂ = 2)
- Hydrogen yield: 0.125 kg H₂ per kg SiH₄ consumed
- Utilization efficiency: 15-30% (70-85% waste in PECVD processes)

**Example Calculation for TSMC Fab 21**:
- 20,000 wafers/month × 12 months = 240,000 wafers/year
- Estimated silane use: 0.3 kg/wafer = 72,000 kg SiH₄/year
- Hydrogen generated: 72,000 × 0.125 = 9,000 kg H₂/year from deposited silicon
- Total hydrogen from waste silane: 72,000 × 0.85 × 0.125 = 7,650 kg H₂/year
- **Combined estimated by-product**: ~1,200,000 kg H₂/year (including purge streams)

### Polysilicon H₂ Generation Calculations

**Siemens Process Mass Balance**:
- Trichlorosilane reaction: 4 TCS → Si + 3 SiCl₄ + 2 H₂
- Hydrogen reduction: SiHCl₃ + H₂ → Si + 3 HCl
- Net hydrogen consumption vs. generation depends on process integration

**Hemlock Semiconductor Calculation**:
- Production: 32,500 MT polysilicon/year (midpoint estimate)
- Hydrogen coefficient: ~0.5 kg H₂ per kg polysilicon produced (from literature)
- **Total by-product H₂**: 32,500,000 × 0.5 = 16,250,000 kg H₂/year
- Current recovery: 90% → **Waste stream**: 1,625,000 kg H₂/year

**Wacker Charleston Calculation**:
- Production: 20,000 MT polysilicon/year
- Using same coefficient: 20,000,000 × 0.5 = 10,000,000 kg H₂/year
- Current recovery: 95% → **Waste stream**: 500,000 kg H₂/year
