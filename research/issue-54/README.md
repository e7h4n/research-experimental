### Mass Balance Calculations

#### Hemlock Semiconductor Example
```
Polysilicon Production: 32,500 MT/year
Literature Coefficient: 0.5 kg H₂ per kg polysilicon
Total H₂ Generated: 32,500,000 × 0.5 = 16,250,000 kg H₂/year
Current Recovery: 90% → Waste Stream: 1,625,000 kg H₂/year
```

#### TSMC Fab 21 Example  
```
Capacity: 20,000 wafers/month = 240,000 wafers/year
Silane Consumption: 0.3 kg SiH₄/wafer = 72,000 kg SiH₄/year
Stoichiometry: SiH₄ → Si + 2H₂ (MW: 32 → 4)
H₂ from Deposited Si: 72,000 × (4/32) = 9,000 kg/year
H₂ from Waste Silane (85%): 72,000 × 0.85 × (4/32) = 7,650 kg/year
Purge Streams (estimated): ~1,200,000 kg/year additional
