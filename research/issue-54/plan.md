# Research Plan for Issue #54

## Intent Analysis
**Keywords/Concepts Identified:** 
- By-product hydrogen from semiconductor and photovoltaic manufacturing
- Fuel cell conversion potential
- Industrial energy economics
- Waste hydrogen currently combusted or vented/flared
- Market sizing and regional concentration analysis
- Technical and economic feasibility assessment

**Inferred Research Intent:** 
Comprehensive market assessment to evaluate the commercial viability of deploying fuel cells to capture and convert waste hydrogen from semiconductor and PV manufacturing into electricity. This appears to be for investment/business development purposes, requiring detailed quantification of the addressable market, technical feasibility, and economic potential.

**Key Questions to Answer:**
1. How much by-product hydrogen is actually generated by U.S. semiconductor and PV facilities?
2. What percentage is currently being wasted (combusted/vented) vs. recycled or sold?
3. Is this hydrogen technically suitable for fuel cell conversion after conditioning?
4. What is the economic potential (MW capacity, revenue opportunity)?
5. Are production sources geographically clustered or concentrated among few companies?
6. What are the technical and economic barriers to deployment?

## Research Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Validate core hypothesis - Process chemistry analysis of semiconductor/PV hydrogen by-products
- [ ] Task 2: Build comprehensive U.S. facility inventory with production data
- [ ] Task 3: Quantify by-product hydrogen volumes using mass balance and permit data
- [ ] Task 4: Analyze hydrogen destination splits (recycled/sold/combusted/vented)
- [ ] Task 5: Calculate fuel cell market potential (MW, MWh, economics)
- [ ] Task 6: Map regional clustering and company concentration patterns
- [ ] Task 7: Assess technical feasibility including purity and conditioning requirements
- [ ] Task 8: Economic modeling with LCOE, payback, and sensitivity analysis

## Expected Outcomes
- Definitive market size estimate with confidence bounds for by-product hydrogen
- Clear assessment of technical feasibility for fuel cell deployment
- Economic analysis showing investment potential and key risk factors
- Geographic and company concentration analysis for market strategy
- Comprehensive database of U.S. facilities with quantified hydrogen flows
- Policy and regulatory context affecting market development
