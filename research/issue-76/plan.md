# Research Plan for Issue #76

## Intent Analysis
**Keywords/Concepts Identified:** Google AI APIs, Video Agent, Image Generation, Video Creation, Web Application, Google Login, LLM, 24-hour Hackathon

**Inferred Research Intent:** The user wants to build a video creation agent that leverages Google's AI ecosystem to generate videos from conversational inputs. The workflow involves generating key character/scene images first, then using those images along with a script to create videos. This needs to be delivered as a production-ready web application with Google authentication within a 24-hour hackathon timeframe.

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- What are Google's available AI APIs for LLM, image generation, and video creation?
- What are the technical specifications, limitations, and pricing of these APIs?
- How to architect a scalable web application for AI-driven video creation?
- What is the optimal workflow for text-to-image-to-video generation?
- How to implement Google OAuth authentication securely?
- What tech stack and deployment strategy is best for rapid development (24-hour hackathon)?
- What are the best practices for handling AI API rate limits and costs?

## Research Tasks
- [x] Task 1: Google Cloud AI APIs deep dive (Gemini, Imagen, Video Intelligence API)
- [ ] Task 2: Video creation workflow and pipeline architecture
- [ ] Task 3: Web application architecture for AI services
- [ ] Task 4: Google authentication and security implementation
- [ ] Task 5: Hackathon development strategy and deployment options
- [ ] Task 6: Cost analysis and optimization strategies

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive technical design document for building the video creation agent
- Clear API integration guidelines with code examples
- Deployment strategy suitable for 24-hour hackathon
- Cost estimation and optimization recommendations
- Security best practices for handling user data and API keys
