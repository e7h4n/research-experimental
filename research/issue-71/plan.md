# Research Plan for Issue #71

## Intent Analysis
**Keywords/Concepts Identified:** Claude Code, 自定义 LLM 后端, y-router, claude code router, 第三方解决方案, Claude Code SDK, 自动化工作流

**Inferred Research Intent:** The user wants to understand how to use Claude Code with non-Claude LLM backends (such as OpenAI, Gemini, or local models) through third-party routing solutions. They specifically want technical details about y-router and claude code router, including their capabilities, limitations, and implementation examples. Additionally, they want to understand how Claude Code SDK recommends integrating Claude Code into automated workflows.

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- What are y-router and claude code router, and how do they enable using alternative LLM backends with Claude Code?
- What are the technical implementation details and code examples for these solutions?
- What are the limitations and constraints of using these third-party routing solutions?
- What are the community discussions and real-world experiences from GitHub issues?
- How does the official Claude Code SDK documentation recommend integrating Claude Code into automated workflows?
- What are the best practices and potential pitfalls when using non-Claude backends?

## Research Tasks
- [x] Task 1: Deep research on y-router - functionality, setup, code examples, and limitations
- [x] Task 2: Deep research on claude code router - functionality, setup, code examples, and limitations
- [x] Task 3: Analyze GitHub issues and community discussions for both solutions
- [x] Task 4: Research Claude Code SDK documentation for automation integration
- [x] Task 5: Compare different routing solutions and provide recommendations

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear understanding of how to configure Claude Code with alternative LLM backends
- Practical code examples for implementing y-router and claude code router
- Comprehensive analysis of limitations and trade-offs
- Best practices for integrating Claude Code into automated workflows
- Actionable recommendations for choosing between different routing solutions
