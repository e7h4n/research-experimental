    "Flow Batteries" : 5
    "Emerging (Na-ion, etc.)" : 5
```

Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries dominate with >60% market share due to optimal balance of cost ($115/kWh), safety, and lifespan (3,000-10,000 cycles). Flow batteries show promise for long-duration applications with lowest levelized cost at $0.055/kWh, while sodium-ion emerges as potential low-cost alternative.
