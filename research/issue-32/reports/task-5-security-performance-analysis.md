# Task 5: Security and Performance Analysis - Comparative Evaluation of Isolation and Performance Characteristics

## Overview

This report provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of security models and performance characteristics across different execution environment technologies: traditional containers (Docker), lightweight virtualization (Firecracker microVMs), and cloud platforms (AWS, GCE). The analysis focuses on isolation capabilities, threat models, performance benchmarks, and trade-offs between security and performance.

## Security Analysis Framework

### Threat Model Categories

**Internal Threats:**
- Malicious or buggy code within workloads
- Resource exhaustion and denial of service
- Data leakage between tenant workloads
- Privilege escalation attempts

**External Threats:**
- Host system compromise attempts
- Network-based attacks and lateral movement
- Supply chain attacks via container images
- Infrastructure-level vulnerabilities

**Compliance Requirements:**
- Multi-tenancy isolation standards
- Data residency and sovereignty
- Industry-specific security requirements (PCI, HIPAA, SOX)
- Audit trail and forensic capabilities

## Isolation Technology Comparison

### Docker Container Security Model

**Security Boundaries:**
- **Process Isolation**: Linux namespaces provide process tree separation
- **Filesystem Isolation**: Union filesystems with layered access control
- **Network Isolation**: Virtual networks with bridge and overlay networking
- **Resource Limits**: Control groups (cgroups) for CPU, memory, and I/O constraints

**Security Strengths:**
- **Image Security**: Cryptographic signatures and vulnerability scanning
- **Runtime Security**: Integration with SELinux, AppArmor, and seccomp
- **Registry Security**: Secure image distribution and access controls
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Extensive security tooling and best practices

**Security Limitations:**
- **Shared Kernel**: All containers share the host OS kernel, creating potential attack vectors
- **Privilege Escalation**: Kernel vulnerabilities can affect all containers on the host
- **Container Escape**: Potential for breaking out of container boundaries to access host
- **Multi-tenancy Risks**: Insufficient isolation for hostile multi-tenant scenarios [[1]](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/169642/is-docker-more-secure-than-vms-or-bare-metal)

### Firecracker MicroVM Security Model

**Hardware-Level Isolation:**
- **Separate Kernels**: Each microVM runs its own Linux kernel instance
- **CPU Virtualization**: Hardware-enforced CPU isolation and privilege levels
- **Memory Protection**: Hardware memory management unit (MMU) enforces separation
- **I/O Virtualization**: Virtualized device access prevents direct hardware access

**Security Hardening:**
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Only 5 virtualized devices exposed to guests
- **Memory Safety**: Rust implementation prevents common vulnerability classes
- **Process Jailing**: cgroups, seccomp BPF, and restricted system call access
- **Static Linking**: Reduced dependencies and attack surface in hypervisor

**Security Advantages:**
- **Kernel Exploit Protection**: Guest kernel vulnerabilities cannot affect host or other guests
- **Strong Multi-tenancy**: Hardware isolation suitable for hostile multi-tenant scenarios
- **Rapid Response**: Fast creation/destruction cycles limit persistence of compromised instances
- **Battle-tested**: Production use at AWS scale validates security model [[2]](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/firecracker-open-source-secure-fast-microvm-serverless/)

### Traditional VM Security Model

**Full Virtualization Benefits:**
- **Complete OS Isolation**: Each VM runs a complete, isolated operating system
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Hypervisor provides complete hardware abstraction layer
- **Resource Allocation**: Dedicated CPU, memory, and storage allocation per VM
- **Network Isolation**: Virtualized networking with configurable security policies

**Security Trade-offs:**
- **Larger Attack Surface**: Full OS stack increases potential vulnerability exposure
- **Resource Overhead**: Higher memory and CPU overhead reduces density
- **Management Complexity**: Multiple OS instances require individual security management
- **Slower Response**: Longer boot times limit ability to rotate instances quickly
