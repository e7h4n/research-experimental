# Research Plan for Issue #32

## Intent Analysis
**Keywords/Concepts Identified:** e2b, docker, aws, firecracker, gce

**Inferred Research Intent:** The user wants to understand different approaches to secure, scalable code execution environments. This appears to be research into containerization, virtualization, and cloud-based execution platforms, likely for evaluating options for running untrusted code safely or building execution infrastructure.

**Key Questions to Answer:** 
- What is E2B and how does it compare to traditional containerization?
- How do different virtualization technologies (Docker, Firecracker) compare for code execution?
- What are the trade-offs between cloud platforms (AWS, GCE) for execution environments?
- Which approach offers the best security, performance, and cost characteristics for different use cases?

## Research Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: E2B Platform Analysis - Deep dive into E2B's architecture, use cases, and positioning
- [ ] Task 2: Container Technologies Comparison - Docker vs lightweight alternatives for secure execution
- [ ] Task 3: AWS Firecracker Investigation - Microvm technology and serverless execution capabilities
- [ ] Task 4: Cloud Platform Comparison - AWS vs GCE for execution infrastructure
- [ ] Task 5: Security and Performance Analysis - Comparative evaluation of isolation and performance characteristics

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive understanding of modern code execution environment options
- Clear comparison of security models across different technologies
- Performance and cost analysis for various use cases
- Recommendations for choosing between different execution platforms
- Understanding of how these technologies complement or compete with each other
