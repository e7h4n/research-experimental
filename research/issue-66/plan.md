# Research Plan for Issue #66

## Intent Analysis
**Keywords/Concepts Identified:** 面瘫 (facial paralysis), 半边脸突然面瘫下垂 (sudden unilateral facial paralysis), 健康状态 (health conditions), 原因 (causes)

**Inferred Research Intent:** The user wants to understand the medical causes and underlying health conditions that can lead to sudden onset of unilateral facial paralysis (facial drooping on one side). This appears to be a medical research inquiry seeking comprehensive information about potential diagnoses and health implications.

**Key Questions to Answer:** 
- What are the primary medical causes of sudden unilateral facial paralysis?
- What serious health conditions can manifest as facial paralysis?
- How can different causes be differentiated clinically?
- What are the emergency vs. non-emergency causes?
- What diagnostic approaches are used to identify the underlying cause?

## Research Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Research Bell's palsy as the most common cause of sudden facial paralysis
- [ ] Task 2: Investigate stroke and cerebrovascular causes of facial paralysis
- [ ] Task 3: Research infectious causes (viral, bacterial) of facial nerve paralysis
- [ ] Task 4: Investigate tumor-related causes and cranial nerve compression
- [ ] Task 5: Research trauma-related facial paralysis causes
- [ ] Task 6: Investigate autoimmune and inflammatory conditions affecting facial nerve

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive understanding of differential diagnosis for sudden facial paralysis
- Clear categorization of emergency vs. non-emergency causes
- Evidence-based information on prevalence and prognosis of different causes
- Clinical guidance on when urgent medical evaluation is needed
- Understanding of diagnostic workup and treatment approaches
