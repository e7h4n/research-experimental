# 2008 Financial Crisis: Comprehensive Research Report

## Executive Summary

The 2008 Financial Crisis, also known as the Great Recession, was the most severe global financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Beginning with early signs in 2007 and climaxing in 2008, the crisis resulted from a complex web of factors including the subprime mortgage bubble, excessive leverage, complex derivatives, and regulatory failures. The crisis saw unprecedented market declines, with the S&P 500 falling 56.8% from peak to trough, and required massive government intervention through programs like TARP and AIG bailouts totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. Recovery took years, with some indices not returning to pre-crisis levels until 2015.

## Root Causes Analysis

### 1. Housing Bubble Formation
- Creation of housing bubble in late 1990s with rapid increase in home prices well beyond fundamental value
- Excessive speculation on property values by both homeowners and financial institutions
- Federal Reserve's significant decrease in interest rates enabled banks to extend consumer credit at lower rates

### 2. Subprime Lending Expansion
- Share of subprime mortgages increased from 2.5% to nearly 15% per year from late 1990s to 2004-2007
- Banks aggressively marketed subprime loans to customers with poor credit or few assets
- Lenders often misled borrowers about risks, knowing they could not afford to repay

### 3. Securitization and Complex Financial Instruments
- Mortgages bundled into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) allowed risk shifting and lax underwriting
- Banks viewed selling subprime mortgages as MBS as a way to increase liquidity and reduce exposure
- Investors saw MBS purchases as portfolio diversification opportunity

### 4. Derivatives and Credit Default Swaps (CDS)
- Unregulated creation and trade of derivatives with excessive leverage
- CDS volume increased 100-fold from 1998 to 2008
- Estimates of debt covered by CDS contracts ranged from $33-47 trillion by November 2008
- Synthetic CDOs enabled theoretically infinite wagering on finite housing loan values

### 5. Shadow Banking System
- Investment banks and hedge funds operated outside traditional banking regulations
- These entities masked risk-taking through complex, off-balance sheet derivatives and securitizations
- Lack of regulatory oversight for non-depository financial institutions

### 6. Regulatory Deficiencies
- Partial repeal of Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 allowed banks, securities firms, and insurance companies to merge
- Creation of "too big to fail" institutions
- CDS were lightly regulated due to Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000
- Predatory lending practices were insufficiently regulated
