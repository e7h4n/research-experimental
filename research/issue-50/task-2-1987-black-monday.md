# The 1987 Black Monday Stock Market Crash: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Executive Summary

Black Monday, October 19, 1987, represents one of the most significant single-day stock market crashes in financial history. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 508 points (22.6%), the S&P 500 fell 20.4%, and NASDAQ dropped 11.35% in a single trading session. This crash wiped out approximately $500 billion in market capitalization and triggered a global financial crisis affecting all 23 major world markets. The crash was caused by a confluence of factors including rising interest rates, trade deficits, currency instability, and most critically, the amplifying effects of computerized portfolio insurance strategies that created destructive feedback loops. Despite the severity of the crash, markets recovered remarkably quickly, with most major indices returning to pre-crash levels within 20-24 months.

## Root Causes and Triggering Factors

### Primary Economic Factors

**1. Interest Rate Environment**
- Federal Reserve raised interest rates throughout 1987 under new Chairman Alan Greenspan
- Rising rates made bonds more attractive relative to stocks
- September 1987 rate hike added pressure to equity markets
- Deutsche Bundesbank responded with its own rate increases

**2. Trade and Budget Deficits**
- Unexpectedly high trade deficit figures announced October 14, 1987
- Deficit concerns put downward pressure on the US dollar
- Created expectations of further interest rate increases
- Treasury Secretary James Baker threatened dollar devaluation on October 17

**3. Currency Instability**
- Crisis of confidence in the US dollar
- Doubts about the viability of the February 1987 Louvre Accord
- International monetary policy coordination concerns
- Dollar weakness pressured domestic monetary policy

**4. Market Overvaluation**
- Stock prices had tripled from 1982-1987 lows
- Price-to-earnings ratios reached historic highs
- Speculative excess in the market
- Concerns about sustainability of valuations

### Technological Amplification Factors

**Portfolio Insurance Strategies:**
- Hedging technique designed to limit losses through automatic selling
- Computer programs set to sell S&P 500 futures when stock prices declined
- Created a feedback loop: falling prices triggered more selling, causing further declines
- Portfolio insurers made up a significant portion of institutional trading

**Program Trading:**
- Computer-driven trading was relatively new in the mid-1980s
- Software programs executed automatic stop-loss orders
- SEC report showed program trades comprised nearly 60% of NYSE volume on Black Monday
- Accelerated the pace of selling as markets declined

**The Cascade Effect:**
- Initial price declines triggered portfolio insurance selling
- This caused further price declines, triggering more selling
- Computer models recommended increasingly aggressive selling as markets fell
- Created a "vicious circle" of automated selling pressure
