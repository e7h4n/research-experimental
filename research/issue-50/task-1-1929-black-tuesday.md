# The 1929 Black Tuesday Stock Market Crash: Comprehensive Analysis

## Executive Summary

The 1929 stock market crash, culminating on "Black Tuesday" (October 29, 1929), represents the most devastating financial collapse in U.S. history and marked the onset of the Great Depression. The crash began on "Black Thursday" (October 24) and intensified through "Black Monday" (October 28) before reaching its climax on Black Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell from its peak of 381.17 in September 1929 to 230.07 by October 29, a 25% decline in just four trading days. The market continued its descent, ultimately reaching 41.22 in July 1932â€”an 89% drop from its peak. Recovery to pre-crash levels took 25 years, not achieved until November 1954.

## Root Causes and Economic Conditions

### Speculation and Market Structure
1. **Excessive Speculation**: Long period of speculation with millions investing savings or borrowed money
2. **Margin Buying**: 
   - Margin requirements as low as 10%
   - Brokers routinely lending over two-thirds of stock face value
   - $8.5 billion in outstanding loans (more than total U.S. currency circulation)
   - 300 million shares carried on margin by summer 1929
   - Total margin loans outstanding: $22.1 billion ($17.7 billion to constrained investors)

### Federal Reserve Policies
1. **Interest Rate Increases**: Discount rate raised from 5% to 6% in August 1929
2. **Credit Tightening**: Policies designed to curb speculation
3. **International Impact**: Gold standard forced foreign central banks to raise rates, triggering global recession

### Underlying Economic Weaknesses
1. **Agricultural Depression**: Overproduction and falling prices forcing farmers into debt
2. **Manufacturing Overcapacity**: Unsellable output due to low wages and purchasing power
3. **Income Distribution**: Poor distribution limiting consumer demand
4. **Employment**: Factory owners cutting production and staff, reducing demand further

### Market Valuation Concerns
1. **P/E Ratios**: S&P Composite stocks averaged 32.6 P/E in September 1929
2. **Expert Warnings**: Public officials condemning "speculative orgy" throughout 1929
3. **Market Sentiment**: Irving Fisher's "permanently high plateau" comment exemplified overconfidence
