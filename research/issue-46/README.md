# Agent Evaluation Methods Research - Issue #46

## Executive Summary

This research addresses two key questions: how leading AI agent companies evaluate their products' effectiveness, and what makes the GAIA benchmark significant for agent evaluation. Our investigation reveals a shift from traditional accuracy-focused benchmarking toward comprehensive, cost-aware evaluation frameworks that prioritize real-world utility.

**Key Findings:**
- Industry evaluation has evolved to multi-dimensional frameworks (CLASSic: Cost, Latency, Accuracy, Stability, Security)
- GAIA benchmark represents a paradigm shift, testing tasks simple for humans but challenging for AI
- Leading companies (Manus AI, Genspark) achieve 86-88% on GAIA vs 15-30% for traditional systems
- Cost-efficiency metrics are becoming as important as accuracy in production deployments

## Research Context and Methodology

The research focused on **authoritative technical sources** including peer-reviewed papers, official company technical blogs, and established research publications. We analyzed evaluation methodologies from leading agent companies while conducting an in-depth investigation of the GAIA benchmark, culminating in a Socratic-style educational article for general audiences.
