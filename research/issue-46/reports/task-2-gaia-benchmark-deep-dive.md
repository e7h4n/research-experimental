### Philosophical Design Principles

GAIA's design philosophy deliberately inverts traditional AI benchmarking approaches:

**Traditional Approach**: Target increasingly difficult tasks for humans
**GAIA Approach**: Focus on tasks simple for humans but challenging for AI

This inversion addresses a critical gap: measuring practical AI capabilities rather than specialized performance in narrow domains.
