# Research Plan for Issue #46

## Intent Analysis
**Keywords/Concepts Identified:** 
- Agent evaluation methods
- Leading agent products (manus, lovart, gama, genspark)
- Mature methodologies for effectiveness testing
- GAIA benchmark evaluation dataset
- Socratic questioning method for popular science writing

**Inferred Research Intent:** 
The user wants to understand how top AI agent companies evaluate their products' performance and effectiveness. They're specifically interested in authoritative, technical sources (blogs, papers) rather than marketing materials. Additionally, they want a deep dive into the GAIA benchmark presented in an accessible, educational format using Socratic questioning.

**Key Questions to Answer:**
1. What are the current industry-standard methods for evaluating AI agent performance?
2. How do leading agent companies (manus, lovart, gama, genspark) approach effectiveness testing?
3. What is GAIA benchmark and why is it significant for agent evaluation?
4. How can complex AI evaluation concepts be explained to a general audience using Socratic questioning?
