## Key Market Dynamics and Drivers

- **Policy Signal**: PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng emphasized goal to restore inflation

#### Federal Reserve Impact
- **Interest Rate Differential**: US-China yield spread peaked at 3.28pp in December 2024
- **Rate Cut Expectations**: Fed dovish pivot provided some yuan support
- **Yield Dynamics**: Narrowing spreads reduced depreciation pressure temporarily

### 2. China's Economic Challenges

#### Deflation Concerns
- **Duration**: Second consecutive year of deflation in 2024
- **Historical Context**: Longest price decline streak since 1960s
- **2024 Inflation**: Headline CPI at 0.3% (y/y) in May, core at 0.6%

### 3. Capital Flow Dynamics

#### Structural Outflow Pressures

- **Policy Constraints**: PBOC managing outflow concerns while supporting economy

#### PBOC Exchange Rate Management
- **Active Intervention**: Consistently stronger fixing than market indicated

- **Tariff Expectations**: 60%+ tariffs on Chinese goods threatened
- **Depreciation Projections**: Offshore yuan could reach 8.5 per dollar
- **Policy Response**: Controlled depreciation rather than sharp devaluation

### Economic Performance vs Targets
- **GDP Achievement**: 5.0% growth target met for 2024

- **Policy Support**: Gradual adjustment preferred over sharp moves
- **Range Trading**: Likely to trade between 7.0-7.5 in absence of major shocks
- **Intervention Threshold**: PBOC likely to defend against rapid depreciation

### Structural Factors
