## Executive Summary

Over the past 30 years, the CNY/USD exchange rate has undergone a dramatic transformation from a rigid dollar peg to a managed floating system. The Chinese yuan has generally appreciated from around 8.7 yuan per dollar in 1994 to approximately 7.2 yuan per dollar in 2024, representing a long-term strengthening trend interrupted by periods of devaluation during economic crises and trade tensions.

### Phase 7: Trade War Era (2018-2021)
- **Pressure Point**: US-China trade tensions escalated exchange rate volatility
- **Tariff Impact**: US tariffs reached ~20% on Chinese goods by 2021
- **Yuan Response**: Used as buffer against trade pressures
