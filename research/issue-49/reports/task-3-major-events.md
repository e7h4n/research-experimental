# Task 3: Major Events Impact Analysis - Key Events Affecting CNY/USD Exchange Rate

## Executive Summary

Over the past 30 years, several major geopolitical and economic events have profoundly shaped the CNY/USD exchange rate trajectory. These events demonstrate China's evolution from a rigid currency peg system to a more flexible but still managed regime, with each crisis prompting policy adaptations that reflected China's changing economic priorities and international integration.

#### Context and Regional Impact
- **Crisis Onset**: July 1997, beginning in Thailand and spreading across East Asia
- **Regional Devastation**: Major currency devaluations across Southeast Asia

- **Gradual Approach**: Irregular appreciation through 2015
- **Market Confidence**: Restored two-way exchange rate movement

### 7. August 2015 Devaluation Shock

#### Market Disruption Event

```

**Market Consequences**:

- Nearly $1 trillion left China in 2016
- Required aggressive capital control measures

### 8. US-China Trade War (March 2018-Present)

#### Escalation Timeline
- **March 22, 2018**: Trump announced China tariffs
- **Progressive Escalation**: Tariffs reached ~20% on Chinese goods by 2021
- **Phase One Agreement**: January 2020 temporary stabilization

#### Exchange Rate Weapon
**Currency as Trade Buffer**:
- Yuan depreciation used to offset tariff impacts
- Affected regional currencies (AUD, EUR, JPY, KRW, SGD, ZAR)
- Created ongoing tension over currency manipulation

**Policy Response Pattern**:
- Controlled depreciation rather than sharp devaluation
- Maintained stability as priority over competitive advantage
- Balanced domestic needs with international responsibilities

### 9. COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2021)

#### Crisis Response and Recovery
**Initial Weakness (Early 2020)**:
- Yuan devalued at pandemic onset
- Market uncertainty and capital flight concerns
- Economic lockdowns impacted trade flows

**Strong Recovery (Late 2020-2021)**:

    line [7.0, 7.15, 6.9, 6.7, 6.5, 6.45]
```

**Recovery Factors**:
- Effective pandemic control created favorable conditions
- Higher interest rates vs developed markets (Fed cut to zero)
- Biden election victory boosted yuan expectations
- Strong export performance during global recovery

**Policy Innovation**:
- Maintained intervention through state banks
- Concealed intervention via offshore subsidiary lending
- Missed opportunity for greater exchange rate flexibility

### 10. Current Challenge - Trump 2.0 Era (2024-Present)

#### Renewed Trade Tensions
- **Election Impact**: Yuan lost 3%+ since November 2024 Trump victory
- **Tariff Threats**: 60%+ tariffs on Chinese goods promised
- **Market Expectations**: Offshore yuan could reach 8.5 per dollar
