# Task 4: Future Scenarios Analysis - CNY/USD Possibilities and Signaling Events (2025-2030)

## Executive Summary

The CNY/USD exchange rate faces multiple possible trajectories over 2025-2030, driven by US-China trade tensions, monetary policy divergence, China's economic transition, and yuan internationalization efforts. Four primary scenarios emerge, ranging from managed stability to crisis-driven volatility, each with distinct signaling events that could trigger different outcomes.

### Consensus Projections
- **Trading Range**: 7.0-7.5 CNY/USD with managed flexibility
- **Average Rate**: 7.12 CNY/USD (equivalent to $0.1404 per CNY)
- **Volatility**: Two-way fluctuations with PBOC intervention support
- **Policy Stance**: Gradual, orderly depreciation management

### Key Assumptions
- Moderate Trump tariff implementation (20-40% vs threatened 60%)
- Fed maintains 2024 rate level with gradual cuts
