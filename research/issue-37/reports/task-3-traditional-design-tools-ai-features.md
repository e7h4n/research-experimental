- Need to prove comprehensive workflow capabilities beyond just generation

## Market Trends and Future Outlook

### Designer Sentiment Toward AI
[Figma's research](https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-2025-ai-report-perspectives/) shows:
- Strong interest in AI among design professionals
- Preference for AI as enhancement rather than replacement
- Need for AI tools that integrate with existing workflows

### Competitive Threat Assessment
- **Traditional Tools' Advantage**: Established workflows, user bases, and feature completeness
- **AI Tools' Opportunity**: Speed, accessibility for non-designers, and novel capabilities
- **Market Reality**: Coexistence rather than replacement in the near term

### Usage Pattern Evolution
- **Professional Designers**: Likely to use traditional tools with AI enhancements
- **Non-Designers**: Gravitating toward AI-native solutions for rapid prototyping
- **Enterprise**: Maintaining traditional tools while experimenting with AI solutions

## Strategic Implications for Google Stitch

### Competitive Positioning Against Traditional Tools

**Advantages:**
- **Cost Barrier**: Free access vs. subscription models
- **Ease of Use**: Lower learning curve for non-designers
- **Speed**: Faster initial design generation

**Challenges:**
- **Feature Completeness**: Limited compared to comprehensive platforms
- **User Migration**: Difficulty attracting users from established tools
- **Workflow Integration**: Need for seamless handoff to traditional tools

### Market Opportunity
Based on market analysis:
- **Untapped Segments**: Non-designers, rapid prototyping, early-stage startups
- **Enterprise Integration**: Potential as complementary tool rather than replacement
- **Education Market**: Opportunity in design education and experimentation

## Conclusions

Traditional design tools, led by Figma's commanding 40.65% market share and 13 million monthly active users, are successfully defending their position by integrating AI features rather than being displaced by AI-native tools. 

The market is evolving toward a hybrid model where:
1. **Traditional tools** enhance their platforms with AI capabilities to retain users
2. **AI-native tools** focus on specific use cases and underserved segments
3. **Coexistence** emerges rather than complete market disruption

For Google Stitch, success likely depends on finding complementary positioning rather than direct competition with established platforms, potentially serving as an ideation tool that feeds into traditional design workflows.
