- First-mover advantage (2017 launch)
- Attention prediction features
- Established user base

**Relume:**
- Largest user base (1M+ professionals)

- Proven track record (250K+ websites)

### Market Reality Check
Despite the competitive landscape, [testing results show](https://medium.com/@xinranma/i-tested-4-ai-tools-to-generate-ui-from-the-same-prompt-0d2113736cce) that "no AI on the market can replicate a fraction of what a human UX designer can create," indicating the market is still evolving toward more sophisticated solutions.

## Conclusions

The AI UI design tools market is fragmented with several specialized players rather than a single dominant solution. Each competitor has carved out specific niches:

- **Uizard**: Focuses on non-designers and rapid prototyping
- **Relume**: Dominates website/landing page creation
- **Banani**: Targets multi-screen app development
- **Google Stitch**: Positions as a free, comprehensive starting point

The lack of a clear market leader suggests room for Google Stitch to establish a significant position, especially given its free access and advanced AI capabilities. However, success will depend on transitioning from experimental status to a fully-supported product with robust marketing.
