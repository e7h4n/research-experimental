## Key Market Observations

### Growth Drivers
1. **NaszEauto Program Impact** (2025): New subsidy program launched February 2025 with 1.6 billion PLN budget drove significant H1 2025 growth
2. **Record Monthly Performance**: June 2025 achieved highest monthly registrations (3,779 units) and market share (7.6%)
3. **Recovery Trajectory**: Strong rebound from 2024 decline, with 61% H1 growth suggesting full-year 2025 could exceed 25,000 units

### Market Challenges
1. **Subsidy Dependency**: 2024 decline directly correlated with "Mój elektryk" program suspension
2. **EU Position**: Poland maintains one of EU's lowest BEV penetration rates (only ahead of Croatia and Slovakia)
3. **Market Volatility**: Significant fluctuations based on government incentive availability

## Total BEV Fleet Size
- **June 2024**: 61,976 passenger BEVs (54% year-over-year increase)
- **Total BEVs** (all categories): 68,792 units
