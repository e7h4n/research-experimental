# Task 1: Prion Definition and Characteristics

## Scientific Definition

Prions are infectious particles composed of abnormally folded proteins that cause progressive neurodegenerative diseases. According to the [Chemistry LibreTexts](https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/University_of_Arkansas_Little_Rock/CHEM_4320_5320:_Biochemistry_1/02:__Protein_Structure/2.4:_Protein_Folding_and_Prions), prions propagate by transmitting a misfolded protein state, with all known mammalian prion diseases caused by the prion protein (PrP).

The term "prion" was coined because they are made of protein and are infectious particles that are smaller than viruses and [contain no nucleic acids (neither DNA nor RNA)](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Microbiology/Microbiology_(OpenStax)/06:_Acellular_Pathogens/6.04:_Viroids_Virusoids_and_Prions).

## Structural Characteristics

### Normal vs. Misfolded Forms

The prion protein exists in two distinct conformational states:

- **PrPᶜ (Cellular)**: The normal, properly-folded form that is [predominantly α-helical and soluble](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3330701/)
- **PrPˢᶜ (Scrapie)**: The disease-linked, misfolded form that [adopts a β-sheet-rich conformation that resists proteolytic degradation and promotes aggregation into amyloid fibrils](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3330701/)

### Molecular Structure

According to recent research, [prions are intrinsically disordered proteins that continuously change conformation unless bound to a specific partner](https://bio.libretexts.org/Courses/University_of_Arkansas_Little_Rock/CHEM_4320_5320:_Biochemistry_1/02:__Protein_Structure/2.4:_Protein_Folding_and_Prions). Once a prion binds to another in the same conformation, it stabilizes and can form fibrils, leading to abnormal protein aggregates called amyloids.

## Mechanism of Action

### Conversion Process

The fundamental mechanism by which prions cause disease is through protein misfolding cascades. When [a prion enters a healthy organism, it induces existing, properly-folded proteins to convert into the disease-associated, prion form](https://bio.libretexts.org/Courses/University_of_Arkansas_Little_Rock/CHEM_4320_5320:_Biochemistry_1/02:__Protein_Structure/2.4:_Protein_Folding_and_Prions). The misfolded prion then acts as a template to guide the misfolding of more proteins into prion form.

This [conformational transition from the α-helix-rich cellular form into the mainly β-sheet containing counterpart initiates an 'autocatalytic' reaction which leads to the accumulation of amyloid fibrils in the central nervous system (CNS) and to neurodegeneration](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3330701/).

## Species-Specific Folding Differences

Recent 2025 research published in [PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2416191122) revealed important differences in folding behavior between PrP molecules from species with different disease susceptibility:

- **Dogs**: Immune to prion diseases
- **Hamsters**: Susceptible to prion diseases  
- **Bank voles**: Extremely susceptible to prion diseases

The study found that [subtle differences in PrP sequence between species produce profound changes in folding behavior, providing insight into the factors underlying misfolding propensity](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2416191122).

## Disease Characteristics

[All known prion diseases affect the structure of neural tissue, are currently untreatable and universally fatal](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/Supplemental_Modules_(Molecular_Biology)/Prions). The diseases are characterized by:

1. Progressive neurodegeneration
2. Formation of amyloid plaques in brain tissue
3. Spongiform (sponge-like) changes in brain tissue
4. Long incubation periods
5. Invariably fatal outcomes

## Structural Knowledge Gaps

Despite decades of research, [the precise structure of the prion is not known](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3330701/), though they can be formed by combining PrPᶜ, polyadenylic acid, and lipids in a Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA) reaction. The [exact molecular mechanisms which lead to the conformational change are still unknown](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3330701/).
