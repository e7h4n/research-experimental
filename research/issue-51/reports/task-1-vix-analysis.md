- Below the historical median of 17.61
- Within the lower portion of typical volatility ranges
- Suggesting current market complacency
- Year-over-year decline of -23.72%

## Volatility Regime Analysis

### Current Environment Characteristics
1. **Low Volatility Regime**: Current levels suggest market participants expect low volatility over the next 30 days
2. **Complacency Indicators**: VIX has drifted into complacency territory with stretched short positioning
3. **Structural Conditions**: Steep front-end contango present in VIX futures structure

### 2025 Volatility Events
Notable volatility spikes occurred in 2025, particularly:
- **April 2025**: Three major movements in the 99th percentile of historical changes since 1990
- **Catalyst**: Presidential announcements regarding broad tariffs and international trade retaliation

## Risk Assessment

### Mean Reversion Potential
Given the current low percentile positioning:
- **Historical Pattern**: VIX typically bottoms around 17-18, current level at 15 suggests potential for mean reversion
- **Catalyst Risk**: Low volatility environments can shift rapidly during market stress
- **Positioning Risk**: Heavy short VIX positioning increases potential for volatility spikes

### Investment Implications
- Current levels offer **asymmetric risk/reward** for volatility exposure
- Mean reversion probability favors higher volatility expectations
- Market complacency creates conditions for sudden volatility expansion
