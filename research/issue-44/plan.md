# Research Plan for Issue #44

## Intent Analysis
**Keywords/Concepts Identified:** Large language models, API pricing, performance metrics, multimodal capabilities, token limits, Claude, OpenAI, LLaMA, DeepSeek, Chinese AI models, Gemini, QWEN

**Inferred Research Intent:** The user needs comprehensive comparison data for mainstream LLM models to make informed decisions about model selection. They require specific technical specifications and pricing information for enterprise or development use cases.

**Key Questions to Answer:** 
- What are the current API pricing structures for each model family?
- What are the performance characteristics (token speeds, limits) for each model?
- Which models support multimodal inputs?
- How do Chinese models compare to Western models in terms of capabilities and pricing?

## Research Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Research Claude model family specifications (3.5, 4.0/4.1)
- [ ] Task 2: Research OpenAI model specifications (all current models)
- [ ] Task 3: Research Meta LLaMA model specifications (multiple generations)
- [ ] Task 4: Research DeepSeek model specifications (V3, V3.1, R1)
- [ ] Task 5: Research Chinese AI models (Kimi K2, GLM4, QWEN series, Doubao)
- [ ] Task 6: Research Google Gemini model specifications (2.5 Pro, Flash)
- [ ] Task 7: Compile comprehensive comparison table with all specifications

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive markdown table with pricing, performance, and capability data
- Authoritative information sourced from official API documentation
- Clear comparison of multimodal capabilities across models
- Understanding of competitive landscape between Western and Chinese models
