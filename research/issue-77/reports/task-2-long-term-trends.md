# Task 2: Multi-Year Trends and Long-Term Historical Analysis

## Historical Overview: Four Decades of Treasury Yields

### The Complete Cycle (1980-2025)

According to [Macrotrends historical data](https://www.macrotrends.net/2016/10-year-treasury-bond-rate-yield-chart) and [FRED data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10), the US 10-year Treasury yield has experienced a complete multi-decade cycle:

- **Historic Peak (October 1981)**: **15.68%** - The highest recorded yield in modern history
- **Historic Low (August 2020)**: **0.55%** - The lowest yield ever recorded
- **Current Level (September 2025)**: **~4.05%** - Mid-range between extremes

## Major Era Analysis

### 1. The Volcker Era and Great Disinflation (1980-1990)

According to [Advisor Perspectives analysis](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2025/05/01/10-year-treasury-yield-long-term-perspective-april-2025):
- **Context**: "The stagflation crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s demanded drastic measures"
- **Fed Action**: "Under Paul Volcker's leadership, the Federal Reserve pushed the FFR to a historic high of 20.06% in January 1981"
- **Peak Yield**: "Nine months later, the 10-year yield's weekly average hit its peak of 15.68% in October"
- **Result**: "This aggressive tightening was instrumental in curbing runaway inflation, albeit at the cost of a significant economic slowdown"

### 2. The Great Moderation (1990-2007)

Key characteristics of this period:
- Steady decline in yields from double digits to 3-5% range
- Stable economic growth with moderate inflation
- Yields typically ranged between **3.5% - 6.5%**
- Average yield during this period: approximately **5.5%**

### 3. Financial Crisis and QE Era (2008-2015)

According to [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58457) and [Wikipedia QE data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing):

**Pre-Crisis Baseline**:
- "The U.S. Federal Reserve System held between $700 billion and $800 billion of Treasury notes on its balance sheet before the recession"

**Quantitative Easing Programs**:
- **QE1 (Nov 2008 - Sept 2009)**: "The Fed purchased almost $2 trillion in mortgage-related assets and longer-term Treasury Securities"
- **QE2 (Nov 2010 - June 2011)**: "The Fed purchased $600 billion in Treasury securities"
- **QE3 (Sept 2012 - Oct 2014)**: "The Fed purchased about $85 billion in mortgage-related assets and Treasury securities each month"

**Impact on Yields**:
- According to [Brookings research](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/quantitative-easing-lowered-interest-rates-why-isnt-quantitative-tightening-lifting-them-more/): "Economists from the Fed and elsewhere have estimated that the asset purchases lowered long-term interest rates by about 1.5 percentage points"
- Yields declined from crisis peaks of ~4% to lows near **1.5%** in 2012 and 2016

### 4. Normalization Attempt (2016-2019)

**First Quantitative Tightening Period**:
According to [Brookings analysis](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/quantitative-easing-lowered-interest-rates-why-isnt-quantitative-tightening-lifting-them-more/):
- "When the Fed announced in 2017 that it was beginning to shrink its portfolio... In reality, yields fell slightly over the course of 2017"
- "The Fed was able to bring its balance sheet back below $4 trillion, and bank reserves shrank to around $1.5 trillion"
- "However, it had to abandon QT in 2019 and start buying T-bills again as liquidity dried up, sparking a crisis in repo markets"

### 5. Pandemic Response (2020-2022)

According to [Emory Economics Review](https://emoryeconomicsreview.org/articles/2024/12/22/quantitative-easing-and-quantitative-tightening-a-quadruple-edged-sword):
- **Balance Sheet Expansion**: "The Fed's balance sheet more than doubled from about $4 trillion prior to the pandemic to nearly $9 trillion at the start of 2022"
- **Yield Impact**: The 10-year Treasury yield hit historic low of **0.55% in August 2020**
- **Estimated Easing**: "Delivered balance sheet easing of between 1.4-2.9% in 2020 and 2021"

### 6. Current Tightening Cycle (2022-2025)

According to [IDN Financials](https://www.idnfinancials.com/news/56041/three-years-of-quantitative-tightening-will-the-fed-now-lower-rates) and [CBO projections](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58457):
- **QT Start**: "The Fed ended its quantitative easing (QE) programme in April 2022 and launched QT in June of the same year"
- **Balance Sheet Reduction**: "As of June 2025, after three years of QT, the Fed has trimmed USD 2.31 trillion, or 25.7% of its total assets"
- **Yield Response**: 10-year yields rose from pandemic lows to peak near **5%** in late 2023

## Long-Term Structural Trends

### The 40-Year Bond Bull Market (1981-2020)

- **Duration**: 39 years of generally declining yields
- **Total Decline**: From 15.68% to 0.55% = **15.13 percentage points**
- **Average Annual Decline**: Approximately 0.39 percentage points per year

### Key Inflection Points

1. **1981**: Peak yields during Volcker's inflation fight
2. **1994**: Brief spike to 8% during Greenspan tightening
3. **2000**: Tech bubble peak, yields near 6.5%
4. **2007**: Pre-crisis peak near 5.3%
5. **2020**: Pandemic low at 0.55%
6. **2023**: Post-pandemic peak approaching 5%

## Current Position in Historical Context

According to [Advisor Perspectives July 2025 report](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2025/08/01/10-year-treasury-yield-long-term-perspective-july-2025):
- **July 2025 Average**: 4.39%
- **Inflation Rate**: 2.67%
- **Real Yield**: Approximately 1.72%

### Historical Comparison
- Current yields (~4%) are:
  - **74% below** the 1981 peak
  - **630% above** the 2020 low
  - **Close to** the 40-year median of approximately 4.5%

## Quantitative Easing/Tightening Impact Assessment

According to [BlackRock research](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/insights/fed-balance-sheet):
- "The balance sheet continues to exert a powerful downward force on US bond yields"
- "The composition of the balance sheet today is likely suppressing 10-year yields by over 2% and potentially by as much as 4%"

### Asymmetric Effects
Per [Emory Economics Review](https://emoryeconomicsreview.org/articles/2024/12/22/quantitative-easing-and-quantitative-tightening-a-quadruple-edged-sword):
- "One month after a one-standard-deviation QT surprise... there was a cumulative 30 basis point increase in the two-year yield"
- "In contrast, a one-standard-deviation QE surprise had an insignificant effect, with only a 5 basis point rise"

## Long-Term Implications

### Structural Factors Supporting Higher Yields
1. **Fiscal Concerns**: Large government deficits requiring Treasury issuance
2. **Inflation Persistence**: Core inflation remaining above Fed target
3. **QT Continuation**: Ongoing balance sheet reduction

### Factors Supporting Lower Yields
1. **Demographic Trends**: Aging population increasing demand for safe assets
2. **Global Demand**: International appetite for US Treasuries as reserve assets
3. **Technology Deflation**: Continued technological progress dampening inflation

## Key Takeaways

1. **Complete Cycle**: The 1981-2020 period represents one of history's longest bond bull markets
2. **New Regime**: Post-2020 appears to mark a regime change with yields normalizing higher
3. **QE/QT Effects**: Central bank balance sheet policies have fundamentally altered yield dynamics
4. **Current Position**: At ~4%, yields sit near long-term median levels but well above recent history
5. **Future Range**: Structural factors suggest a "new normal" range of 3.5% - 5.0% for the foreseeable future
