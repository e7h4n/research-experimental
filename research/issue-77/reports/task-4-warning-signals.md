# Task 4: Warning Signals and Risk Indicators for Treasury Market

## Critical Warning Signals to Monitor

### 1. Yield Curve Dynamics

#### Current Status and Implications
According to [FinancialContent Market Analysis](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2025-9-9-yield-curve-steeps-amidst-weakening-labor-market-a-looming-recession-or-strategic-pivot-for-the-us-economy):
- **Current Spread (10Y-2Y)**: "Well into positive territory at **0.59%**" as of September 2025
- **30Y-2Y Spread**: Widened to **+122 basis points** by mid-August 2025
- **Historical Context**: "The curve remained inverted from October 2022 until December 2024" - the longest inversion on record

#### Warning Signal Interpretation
According to [JP Morgan Asset Management](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/market-updates/on-the-minds-of-investors/was-the-yield-curve-inversion-wrong-in-predicting-a-us-recession/):
- "Since 1960, the spread between the 3-month and 10-year Treasury yield has inverted before every U.S. recession"
- Only one false positive in 1966
- "Investors are still cautious around the general rosy economic outlook for 2025 following the prolonged inversion"

#### Critical Threshold
Per [Current Market Valuation](https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/models/yield-curve.php):
- Model rates a **"Very High" likelihood of recession** for 0-6 months following yield curve normalization
- The type of steepening matters: "Bull steepener" (short rates falling faster) typically precedes recession

### 2. Real Yields and Inflation Expectations

#### Current Metrics
According to [FRED data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10YIE) and [TIPSWatch](https://tipswatch.com/2025/05/22/10-year-tips-reopening-auction-gets-real-yield-of-2-220-2nd-highest-in-16-years/):

- **Historical Average Real Yield**: Only **1.33%** since August 1998

#### Warning Thresholds
- **Real yields above 2.5%**: Signal excessive monetary tightness

LOW        | QT Progress | Ongoing | $2.3T reduced
MEDIUM     | Inflation | 3.1% core | Above target
HIGH       | Trade Wars | Active | Tariffs elevated
MEDIUM     | BOJ Policy | Tightening | 0.50% rate

```

## Action Thresholds for Investors

### Immediate Action Required
- 10-year yield breaking above **4.5%** or below **3.5%**
- Yield curve re-inverting after normalization
- Fed pivoting from current guidance

### Heightened Monitoring
- Real yields exceeding **2.5%**
- Breakeven inflation outside **1.5% - 3.0%** range

### Portfolio Adjustment Considerations
- Duration reduction if yields approaching **5%**
- Credit quality upgrade if recession probability exceeds **70%**
- Geographic diversification if trade wars escalate

## Key Takeaways

1. **Multiple Warning Signals Active**: Yield curve normalization, elevated real yields, and fiscal concerns all flashing caution
2. **Recession Risk Elevated**: 60% probability per JP Morgan, with yield curve history suggesting high risk
3. **Policy Uncertainty High**: Fed caught between inflation and growth concerns
4. **International Spillovers**: BOJ tightening and trade wars adding complexity
5. **Critical Period**: Next 3-6 months crucial for determining economic trajectory
