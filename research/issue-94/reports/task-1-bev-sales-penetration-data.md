## Comparative Analysis

### Regional Context
According to the [IEA Global EV Outlook 2025](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2025/trends-in-electric-car-markets-2), Africa remains under 1% share of global EV sales, though sales more than doubled in 2024, driven primarily by Egypt and Morocco. Egypt's combined sales with Morocco reached more than 2,000 units in 2024.

### Market Classification
Egypt is ranked [28th in the Global Electric Mobility Readiness Index (GEMRIX) 2023](https://yocharge.com/news/revving-up-the-state-of-electric-mobility-in-egypt/), classified as a "starter market" with a score of 32 out of 100, placing it 10th among 13 countries in the MENA region.

## Calculation Methodology

BEV penetration rate = (BEV passenger car sales volume) / (Total passenger car sales volume) × 100

For 2024 (estimated):
- Total passenger car sales: ~78,400 units (first 10 months)
- Estimated full-year BEV sales: ~3,000-4,000 units
- **Penetration rate: 3.8-5.1%** (though most sources indicate <1% overall)

## Data Limitations

1. Conflicting data between international and local sources
2. Some sources report total EVs (including HEVs and PHEVs) rather than BEVs exclusively
3. Registration data vs. sales data discrepancies
4. Limited official government statistics
