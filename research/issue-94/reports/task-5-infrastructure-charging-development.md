# Task 5: Infrastructure and Charging Network Development in Egypt

## Executive Summary
Egypt's EV charging infrastructure remains underdeveloped with approximately 300-700 operational charging points as of late 2024. While ambitious expansion plans target 3,000+ public chargers by 2027, geographic distribution and infrastructure gaps present significant challenges to BEV adoption.

## Current Infrastructure Status

### Operational Charging Points
According to various sources, the current infrastructure includes:
- [300 functional charging points](https://egyptianstreets.com/2025/02/05/egypts-electric-vehicle-future-potential-and-challenges-ahead/) (late 2024 estimate)
- [700+ charging points managed by Infinity](https://infinityevcharge.com/) across 16 governorates (February 2025)
- Over [7,000 EVs on the road](https://newenergyeg.com/electric-vehicle-charging-stations-in-egypt-2025-guide-by-new-energy/) served by this infrastructure

### Geographic Distribution
The charging network shows significant geographic concentration:
- **Primary locations:** New Cairo and Sheikh Zayed (affluent suburbs)
- **Coverage gaps:** No stations in downtown Cairo
- **Limited highway coverage:** Insufficient inter-city charging infrastructure

## Major Infrastructure Providers

**Level 1 Chargers:**
- Standard 220V outlet
- Suitable for overnight home charging
- Slowest charging option

**Level 2 Chargers:**
- Faster than Level 1
- Ideal for residential compounds, shopping malls, offices
- Most common in semi-public locations

**DC Fast Chargers:**
- Rapid charging capability
- Limited availability
- Concentrated in commercial areas

### Charging Costs
Current pricing structure:
- **Home charging (AC):** EGP 50-90 ($1.00-$1.79) per full charge
- **Public stations (DC):** EGP 150-250 ($2.99-$4.98) per session
- Price differential of 3x between home and public charging

## Government Investment and Targets

### Financial Commitment
The [Egyptian government has pledged](https://www.ev24.africa/ev-incentives-and-charging-infrastructure-in-egypt-whats-buyers-should-know/):
- **Investment:** EGP 450 million (USD 8 million)
- **Purpose:** Establish nationwide charging network
- **Timeline:** Implementation through 2027

### Infrastructure Goals
Government targets include:
- **2027 target:** Over 3,000 public EV chargers
- **Strategic placement:** Focus on urban centers and highways
- **Grid integration:** Coordination with electricity distribution companies

## Grid Integration and Power Supply

### Renewable Energy Integration
According to [MDPI's 2024 study](https://www.mdpi.com/2032-6653/16/8/423), opportunities exist for:
- Synergies with Benban Solar Park (one of world's largest)
- Solar PV generation integration with EV charging
- Potential for vehicle-to-grid technologies

### Grid Capacity Challenges
[Scientific Reports analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-75039-3) highlights:
- Need for grid upgrades to support mass EV adoption
- Peak load management requirements
- Distribution network reinforcement needs

## Infrastructure Development Challenges

### Key Barriers
According to [Egyptian Streets](https://egyptianstreets.com/2025/02/05/egypts-electric-vehicle-future-potential-and-challenges-ahead/):
- **Distribution inequality:** Concentration in affluent areas only
- **Growth pace:** Infrastructure struggling to keep up with demand
- **Demand growth:** Charging demand has doubled during transition period

### Technical Challenges
- Grid stability concerns
- Standardization issues
- Maintenance and reliability
- Payment system integration

## Regulatory Framework

### Licensing Structure
Currently, [only 5 companies are licensed](https://yocharge.com/news/revving-up-the-state-of-electric-mobility-in-egypt/) to operate charging stations in Egypt:
