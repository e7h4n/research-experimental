## Current Market Parallels

### Valuation Similarities
According to [Project Syndicate](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-economic-policy-could-lead-to-us-stock-market-crash-by-desmond-lachman-2025-08):
- Current valuations "reminiscent of periods just before significant market corrections in 2000 and 1929"
- CAPE levels surpassed only in 1929, 1999, and 2007

### 2025 Market Events
Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_stock_market_crash):
- **April 2, 2025**: Global markets crashed amid tariff policy announcements
- Largest decline since 2020 COVID crash
- Triggered by policy uncertainty and panic selling

## Correction Frequency

### Minor vs Major Corrections
Based on [Covenant Wealth Advisors](https://www.covenantwealthadvisors.com/post/understanding-stock-market-corrections-and-crashes):
- **10% corrections**: Occur about once per year
- **20% bear markets**: Every 3.5 years on average
- **30%+ crashes**: Approximately every 7-10 years

## Key Lessons from History

1. **Valuations Matter**: Extreme valuations preceded all major crashes
2. **Duration Varies**: Bear markets last 9.6 months on average but can extend years
3. **Recovery Certain**: Markets always recovered but timing varies (months to decades)
4. **Catalysts Differ**: Each crash has unique triggers but patterns repeat
5. **Sentiment Extremes**: Euphoria precedes crashes, panic marks bottoms

## Conclusion
Historical patterns suggest the current market exhibits characteristics similar to previous major tops: extreme valuations, prolonged bull market, concentrated leadership, and emerging economic headwinds. While timing is uncertain, the historical precedent for significant corrections from these levels is strong.
