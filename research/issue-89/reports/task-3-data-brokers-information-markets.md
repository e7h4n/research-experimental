[Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/data-broker-market-report) reports similar figures, with the global data broker market size estimated at USD 277.97 billion in 2024 and projected to reach USD 512.45 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 7.3% from 2025 to 2033.

## Role as Information Intermediaries

### Market Making Functions

According to [Policy Review](https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/untamed-and-discreet-role-data-brokers-surveillance-capitalism-transnational-and), data brokers are referred to in numerous ways, including information brokers, resellers, consumer data collection companies, data aggregators, data providers, data suppliers or data intermediaries. They function as crucial intermediaries in the digital economy by:

1. **Aggregating supply**: Collecting data from multiple sources
2. **Processing and enrichment**: Adding value through analysis and categorization
3. **Distribution to demand**: Selling processed data to businesses
4. **Price discovery**: Establishing market values for different data types

### Creating Information Liquidity

[Knowledge Sourcing](https://www.knowledge-sourcing.com/resources/thought-articles/the-role-of-data-brokers-in-marketing-and-advertising/) explains that data brokers aggregate, analyze, and offer access to enormous data sets captured from online transactions, social media, demographics, and other sources. This creates "liquidity" in information markets by:

- Making data readily available to buyers
- Standardizing data formats for easier consumption
- Reducing search and transaction costs
- Enabling real-time data transactions

## Integration with Digital Advertising Markets

### Programmatic Advertising Infrastructure

Data brokers play a critical market-making role in digital advertising. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/programmatic-advertising-market-size-surpass-083000838.html), the Programmatic Advertising Market size was valued at USD 833.16 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 4,397.68 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 23.21%.

[Credence Research](https://www.credenceresearch.com/report/demand-side-platforms-dsp-for-programmatic-advertising-market) reports that Demand Side Platforms (DSP) for Programmatic Advertising Market is projected to grow from USD 22,544 million in 2024 to USD 68,008.95 million by 2032, at a CAGR of 14.8%.

### Real-Time Bidding Parallels
