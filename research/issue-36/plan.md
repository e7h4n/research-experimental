# Research Plan for Issue #36

## Intent Analysis
**Keywords/Concepts Identified:** Large Language Models (LLM) comparison, API pricing, performance metrics, token limits, multimodal capabilities

**Inferred Research Intent:** The user wants a comprehensive comparison of mainstream large language models to understand their capabilities, costs, and technical specifications for making informed decisions about which models to use for different applications.

**Key Questions to Answer:** 
- What are the input/output pricing structures for each model?
- What are the token processing speeds (input/output)?
- What are the context window limits (input/output tokens)?
- Which models support multimodal input?
- How do these models compare across different performance and cost metrics?

## Research Tasks
- [x] Task 1: Analyze research intent and create comprehensive plan
- [ ] Task 2: Research Claude models (3.5, 3.7/4.0/4.1) - pricing, speeds, limits, multimodal
- [ ] Task 3: Research OpenAI models (all current models) - GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc.
- [ ] Task 4: Research LLaMA models (multiple generations)
- [ ] Task 5: Research DeepSeek models (V3, V3.1, R1)
- [ ] Task 6: Research Kimi K2 model specifications
- [ ] Task 7: Research 智谱 GLM4 model details
- [ ] Task 8: Research Google Gemini models (2.5 pro, flash)
- [ ] Task 9: Research QWEN models (MAX, 3_32B, CODER versions)
- [ ] Task 10: Research 字节豆包 (ByteDance Doubao) models
- [ ] Task 11: Synthesize all findings into comprehensive markdown table format

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive comparison table in markdown format showing pricing, performance, and capabilities
- Clear understanding of which models offer best value for different use cases
- Accurate official API pricing information and technical specifications
- Analysis of multimodal capabilities across different providers
